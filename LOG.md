# Work log (autonomous run)

Started 2026-09-27. Each item: its own branch and PR, CI green (guards, typecheck, tests, Docker), then merged into the integration branch `claude/rat-race-planning-1qouxa`. `main` is never touched: the integration PR [#27](https://github.com/MikuEspana/rat/pull/27) stays open for Miguel to merge ("merge everything" was read as: merge every item PR into the integration branch).

Hard limits kept throughout: DRY RUN on, no mainnet transaction, no Jito call, test keypairs only, no secrets, no cloud accounts, no holder payouts, no safety check weakened, no em dashes.

## Q1. Remove vanity keys

**What changed**
- Every rat now gets a fresh normal keypair at hire time (`KeyStore.newRatKey()`). It is encrypted (AES-256-GCM, public key bound as AAD), inserted, then **read back and decrypted** before its address is returned. Only then is the swap built and the hire sent, so a crash right after sending can never lose the key of a funded wallet.
- Rat keys are never reused. A hire abandoned before any transaction (spend cap, no route, price check) retires the key (`status = unused`); `rat dry-run-reset` retires paper wallets the same way.
- Removed: the vanity grinder, the key pool and its refill, pool alerts (`keypool_low`, `keypool_runway`, grinder alerts), the key pool loop, the `keys grind` / `keys import-dir` / `keys pool` commands, `solana-keygen` (wrapper, test double, Docker stage, CI steps), the `VANITY_SUFFIX` / `KEYPOOL_*` / `SOLANA_KEYGEN_PATH` settings, and the `keypool_empty` hire block (it can no longer happen).
- Kept: AES-256-GCM vault, key rotation, creator/fund import, "no plaintext key in DB or logs" tests, the restart-safe hire state machine.
- Mock data and the live mock API use normal addresses; `CONTRACT.md` says the wallet has no suffix.
- Docs: `README.md`, `keys.md`, `go-live.md`, `deploy.md`, `incident.md`, CLI/worker READMEs, smoke README, `OPEN-QUESTIONS.md` #5 (resolved), `STATUS.md`, `ROADMAP.md` (note that it is the original plan).

**Tests added / changed**
- `apps/worker/src/worker.test.ts`: in both hire modes (single and two-step) the rat's key is in the database at the moment every hire tx is submitted; after a crash (tx landed, confirmation lost) a restarted worker with an empty key cache finishes the hire and can sign for the wallet.
- `packages/keys/src/keys.test.ts`: fresh key per hire, stored and decryptable before return, never reused after discard; a store that loses or corrupts the key makes `newRatKey()` fail (no wallet is ever used whose key did not round trip); no plaintext in DB rows or logs; rotation.
- `packages/db/src/store.test.ts`: a duplicate public key is refused, unused keys are kept but never handed out, `markUnused` never touches creator/fund keys, dry-run reset retires paper wallets.

**Bugs found**: none new. Removed dead paths (key pool empty, refill) that could have blocked hires at launch.

## Q2. Red-team review of every money path

Full write-up with severities: `SECURITY-REVIEW.md`.

**What changed**
- **Effects check** (High): every live claim, hire and burn tx is simulated before sending and refused if any of our wallets would lose more than its reservation, or the rat would get less than the quoted minimum. A compromised Jupiter API can no longer drain the creator or fund wallet. New `TxRequest.limits`, `TxSender.simulateEffects` (RPC: `simulateTransaction` with `accounts` + pre-read; SimChain: dry execute).
- **Send that throws = unknown** (High): an RPC failure while waiting for confirmation no longer releases the reservation of a tx that may have landed.
- **Crash windows** (High/Medium): burn and claim reconcile now find the signature in the attempt log if the worker died mid-send.
- **Claims one at a time** (Medium): no new claim while an earlier one could still land.
- **Lease fence** (Medium): the worker renews its lease right before every send; a worker that lost it sends nothing. `authorize()` is serialized.
- **Jupiter build validation** (Medium): exact input amount, minimum output must honour our slippage.
- **Wallet watch** (Medium/Low): signatures are paged (nothing skipped behind a dust flood), oldest first with a per-loop budget, signer check before the error check, one inflow alert key per wallet.
- **Small ones** (Low): two-step funding fee now inside the salary, overspend alert on settle, sweep refuses own wallets and program addresses and includes failed rats.
- Docs: `SECURITY-REVIEW.md`, `packages/safety/README.md`, `apps/cli/README.md`, go-live runbook (dev buy from a separate wallet).

**Tests added** (30): `apps/worker/src/redteam.test.ts` (12: compromised Jupiter x3, crash windows x3, claim race, watcher x3, lease takeover, two-step cost), `packages/safety/src/safety.test.ts` (12: effects check, fence, throw-after-broadcast, parallel authorize, overspend, limit checker), `packages/jupiter` (1), `packages/chain` (3), `apps/cli` (2). Four of them were run against the old logic first and failed, as expected (race: 5 of 5 authorizations passed with budget for 1).

**Bugs found**: 14, all fixed (3 High, 7 Medium, 4 Low). Accepted risks listed in `SECURITY-REVIEW.md`.
