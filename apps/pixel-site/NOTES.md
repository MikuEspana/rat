# pixel-site notes

Running log of decisions and blockers. Newest first inside each section.

## Blockers

- **2026-09-27 18:57 UTC, PixelLab `create_character` failing.** Every character request (MCP and REST v2, standard mode, 4 or 8 directions, any size) fails within seconds with `Generation failed due to heavy load. Please try again in a moment.` Tiles and map objects work fine at the same time. Failed jobs are not charged (balance confirmed). Retrying in a loop; v3 mode (about 2 generations per character instead of 1) is the fallback if standard stays down.

## PixelLab setup

- The PixelLab MCP tools did not load into the Claude Code session, so every generation calls the PixelLab MCP server directly (`POST https://api.pixellab.ai/mcp`, JSON-RPC `tools/call`, bearer token from `PIXELLAB_API_KEY`). Same tools, same arguments, same credits. The key is never printed or committed.
- Downloads come back inline (base64 PNG) and as `https://api.pixellab.ai/mcp/.../download` links. No other host has been needed so far.
- `create_character` and `create_map_object` take no `seed` over MCP, so regenerating those gives a new variation, not the same pixels. `create_isometric_tile` does take a seed (recorded in the manifest).

## Budget

The account is on a trial: 40 generations total, 0 USD credits.

| Call | Cost (generations) |
|---|---|
| `create_character` standard, 4 or 8 directions | 1 |
| `create_character` v3 | 2 to 9 by size |
| `animate_character` template mode | 1 per direction |
| `animate_character` v3 custom action, 48px | about 1 per direction |
| `create_isometric_tile` | 1 |
| `create_map_object` (basic, any size up to 400x400) | 1 |
| `create_building_kit`, `create_tiles_pro`, `create_character_state`, objects | 20 to 40 (out of budget) |
| `pixelart_workbench` (recolor, edit, draw) | free |
